# Reproducability-Challenge-of-N-BEATS
Some experiments in one of the papers of ICLR 2020(N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting) are reproduced. Due to equipment reasons, not all experiments are carried out. The experimental code and some data sets have been uploaded. This work was jointly completed by Yuzheng Zhang, Yanqiao Cheng, Hongyuan Pan and Jian Wang.
